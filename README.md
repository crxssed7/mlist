# mlist

this was literally built by ai. i could've done this myself but i have no time to maintain a project like this. all it does is display my up next (to read) manga from my [albert api](https://github.com/crxssed7/albert) (which was not built by ai).

it also displays chapter counts for manga that have not finished releasing yet but it's slow asf.
